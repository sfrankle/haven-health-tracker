# Interaction Principles

Version: 1.0
Scope: Cross-screen interaction rules for Haven.

## Core Interaction Rules
1. Logging is faster than thinking.
- Default to taps over typing.
- Surface recent and frequent options first.
- Keep primary logging actions reachable with one hand.

2. One primary action per screen.
- Each screen must have a single dominant purpose.
- Secondary actions are visually quiet and optional.

3. Insights are pull, not push.
- Users opt into insights in Weave.
- Do not inject analytics into the Tend logging flow.

4. No guilt mechanics.
- No streak pressure.
- No negative empty-state language.
- No warning color usage unless real errors occur.

5. Calm by default.
- Stable layouts without abrupt movement.
- Minimal interruptions (dialogs/toasts/banners).
- Motion should support orientation, not attention seeking.

## Data Entry Rules
- Never require free text to save a basic log.
- Prefill with likely values when confidence is high.
- Support quick cancel without losing prior state unexpectedly.
- Confirmation should be concise: "Saved." is sufficient.

## Hierarchy Rules
- Top of screen: orientation context only (date/state), not dense controls.
- Middle: primary task controls.
- Bottom: optional supporting context.
- Keep major sections separated with clear spacing rhythm.

## Error Handling Rules
- Use neutral, actionable errors.
- Explain exactly what failed and how to recover.
- Avoid blame language.

## Accessibility Rules
- Touch targets meet Material minimum size guidance.
- Color is never the only signal.
- Respect system font scaling and dynamic type.

## Motion
- Soft fade between entry states
- No bounce, no celebratory animations
- Motion should not delay interaction readiness
