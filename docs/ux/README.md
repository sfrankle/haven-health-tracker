# UX Specs

These documents define screen layouts, interaction rules, and acceptance criteria.
They are intended to be referenced by implementation issues.

Rule:
- Issues describe tasks.
- UX specs describe the intended behavior and layout.
- If implementation conflicts with UX specs, update the UX spec first, then implement.
