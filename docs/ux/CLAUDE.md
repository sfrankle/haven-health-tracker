# UX Specs — Navigation Guide

These files define screen layouts, interaction rules, and acceptance criteria for implementation work.

## How to use these docs

| File | Use when you need... |
|---|---|
| [interaction-principles.md](interaction-principles.md) | Cross-screen interaction rules (logging speed, no-guilt mechanics, accessibility, error handling) |
| [layout-standards.md](layout-standards.md) | Spacing rhythm and layout rules (canonical values; screen specs reference these) |
| [screen-archetypes.md](screen-archetypes.md) | Layout patterns for all 5 screens — use for Trace, Weave, Settings (no full spec yet); skip in favour of the screen spec below for Tend and Anchor |
| [tend.md](tend.md) | Tend screen spec (logging entry point) |
| [anchor.md](anchor.md) | Anchor screen spec (support menu) |

Screen specs for Trace, Weave, and Settings will be added here as they are written. Once a screen has a full spec, its archetype entry in screen-archetypes.md is superseded.

## Rule

If implementation conflicts with a UX spec, update the spec first, then implement. Issues describe tasks; UX specs describe intended behavior.
