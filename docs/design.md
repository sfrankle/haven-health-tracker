# Design System

Haven's visual language is soft, calming, and non-judgmental.

## Colors

| Role | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary | Soft sage green |
| Secondary | Lavender |
| Background | Off-white |

## Typography

Philosopher is used throughout — bold for headers, regular for body text. Bundled as TTF in `app/src/main/res/font/` (offline-first, no external dependencies).

| Usage | Weight |
|---|---|
| Display, headlines, titles | Philosopher Bold |
| Body, labels | Philosopher Regular |

## Components

- **Buttons:** Pill-shaped with soft shadows
- **Layout:** Rounded grid for entry type buttons
- **Cards:** Rounded with soft shadows
- **Animations:** Smooth transitions

## Principles

- No scores, streaks, or pressure indicators
- Low-friction logging (minimal taps)
- Progressive disclosure (start simple, expand via Settings)
- Non-judgmental language throughout — no "good/bad" framing in any user-facing text
- Accessible: clear navigation, readable fonts, intuitive icons
- All assets local (offline-first, no external dependencies)
