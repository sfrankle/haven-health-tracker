# Haven Design Principles

Version: 1.0
Scope: Product behavior, voice, UX constraints, and accessibility guardrails.

## Brand Essence
Haven is a private, non-judgmental space for noticing patterns in daily life.

Haven should feel:
- Safe
- Airy
- Grounding
- Reliable
- Reflective

Haven should not feel:
- Clinical
- Gamified
- Cutesy or childish
- Motivational-hustle
- Streak-driven

Litmus phrase: a spellbook you could show your doctor.

## Product Positioning
Haven is a personal notebook with intelligence.

Unlike paper, it can:
- Surface pattern observations
- Compute simple correlations
- Remember context over time

Unlike many health apps, it does not:
- Score behavior
- Shame gaps in logging
- Push performance goals

## Voice And Tone
Default tone: neutral, observant, calm.

Haven does not:
- Advise
- Diagnose
- Judge
- Cheerlead

Haven does:
- Reflect logged behavior
- Phrase insights as observations
- Keep copy short and plain

Microcopy examples:
- Use: "You've logged bloating 7 out of 10 times after dairy."
- Use: "Entry saved."
- Avoid: "You should reduce dairy."
- Avoid: "Great job!"
- Avoid: "You missed logging yesterday."

Silence is acceptable when no message is needed.

## UX Principles
### 1) Logging Is Effortless
- One-handed use by default
- Minimal typing
- Smart defaults and recently-used ordering
- Progressive disclosure for advanced inputs
- No required fields unless medically or technically required

### 2) No Performance Pressure
- No streak counters
- No loss indicators
- No guilt language
- No urgency nudges for missed days

### 3) Insights Are Optional
- Insights live in Weave, not Tend
- Insights are visible when requested, not injected into logging flow
- Correlations are presented as observations, not recommendations

## Visual Direction Constraints
- Calm surfaces over dense dashboards
- Muted palette with rare warm accent usage
- No mascots, confetti, trophy metaphors, or reward loops
- Motion should be subtle and low-frequency

## Accessibility And Reliability
- WCAG AA contrast targets
- Tap targets follow Material minimum guidance
- Information never relies on color alone
- Dark mode required (deep tones, avoid pure black)
- Offline-first behavior and local asset availability for core flows

## Privacy Language
Privacy should be explicit but quiet.

Use language like:
- "Your data stays on your device."

Avoid:
- Fear-based or alarmist security copy
