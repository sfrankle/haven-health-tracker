# 1. Brand Essence

## Core Idea
Haven is a private, non-judgmental space for noticing patterns in daily life.

It is:
- Safe
- Airy
- Grounding
- Reliable
- Reflective

It is not:
- Clinical
- Gamified
- Cutesy
- Motivational-hustle
- Streak-driven

Haven feels like:
A softly lit journal at night.
A spellbook that contains data.
A tool you could show your doctor without embarrassment.

---

# 2. Positioning

Haven is a personal notebook with intelligence.

Unlike paper:
- It can calculate correlations.
- It can surface patterns.
- It remembers for you.

Unlike most health apps:
- It does not score you.
- It does not punish you.
- It does not celebrate streaks.
- It does not tell you what to do.

It simply helps you notice.

---

# 3. Voice & Tone

## Default Tone
Neutral, observant, calm.

Haven does not:
- Advise
- Diagnose
- Judge
- Cheerlead

Haven does:
- Reflect back
- State patterns gently
- Offer observations

### Example Microcopy

Instead of:
"You should reduce dairy."

Use:
"You've logged bloating 7 out of 10 times after dairy."

Instead of:
"Great job!"

Use:
"Entry saved."

Instead of:
"You missed logging yesterday."

Use:
No message.

Silence is allowed.

---

# 4. UX Principles

## 4.1 Logging Must Be Effortless

Primary goal: Reduce friction.

- One-handed use.
- Minimal typing.
- Smart defaults.
- Progressive disclosure.
- Frequently used items surface automatically.
- No required fields unless absolutely necessary.

If something feels like filling out a form, redesign it.

---

## 4.2 No Performance Pressure

No:
- Streak counters
- Red badges
- Loss indicators
- “You haven’t logged today” pushiness

The app is there when the user shows up.

---

## 4.3 Intelligence Lives in "Weave"

Insights should:
- Be clearly separated from logging
- Be optional to view
- Not dominate the experience

When showing correlations:

Format:
"You logged [X] on 10 days.
On 7 of those days, you also logged [Y]."

Optional subtle line:
"You may want to explore this further."

Never:
"You should..."

---

# 5. Visual Identity

## 5.1 Emotional Direction

Airy. Grounded. Softly magical.

Not:
Whimsical fantasy.
Not glitter.
Not cartoon.

More:
Bullet journal with beautiful paper.
Subtle dusk light.

---

# 5.2 Color System (Material 3 Tokens)

## Core Brand Gradient (Icon / Hero Surfaces)
- Dusty Blush: #D8A7B1
- Muted Mauve: #A77CA4
- Soft Teal: #5E8B8C

Use sparingly in UI. Primarily for:
- App icon
- Splash
- Special surfaces

---

## Core UI Colors

#2E2A3A

Secondary (Dusty Sage):
#7FA38A

Accent (Warm Glow):
#F6C177

Background (Soft Fog):
#F4F1F3

---

## Color Usage Rule

60% neutral surfaces  
30% muted brand tones  
10% warm glow accent  

Warm glow is rare and meaningful.

---

# 6. Typography

Use Material 3 type scale.

Recommended:
- Primary: Inter or Plus Jakarta Sans
- Slightly increased letter spacing for headers
- Avoid overly sharp geometric fonts

Tone:
Soft, readable, calm.

No script fonts.
No decorative fonts in UI.

---

# 7. Iconography

Style:
- Thin to medium weight
- Rounded edges
- No sharp aggressive corners

Avoid:
- Emoji-style icons
- Playful mascots
- Animated characters

Constellation motif:
- Use sparingly
- In onboarding or insight view
- Not repeated everywhere

---

# 8. Motion

Subtle.

Allowed:
- Soft fade transitions between screens
- Gentle easing (standard Material easing)
- Very occasional twinkle animation in insights view (max once per interaction)

Avoid:
- Bouncy transitions
- Excessive motion
- Gamified feedback loops

If motion draws attention to itself, remove it.

---

# 9. Accessibility

- WCAG AA contrast minimum
- Large tap targets
- Avoid relying on color alone for meaning
- Dark mode is required

Dark mode should feel like:
Deep navy paper, not pure black.

---

# 10. Emotional State at 11pm

When opened late at night, Haven should feel:

Airy.
Spacious.
Grounded.
Safe.

No loud colors.
No strong contrast spikes.
No urgency.

---

# 11. Privacy Positioning

Privacy is core but quiet.

Use:
"Your data stays on your device."

Do not:
Overuse security language.
Create fear-based messaging.

---

# 12. Who This Is For

Designed for:
Someone who wants to understand themselves better.

Not branded explicitly for:
Any identity group.

The app should feel:
Deeply personal.
Universally usable.

---

# 13. Design Litmus Test

Before shipping any feature, ask:

- Is this judging?
- Is this noisy?
- Is this making logging harder?
- Is this trying too hard to be cute?
- Would I show this to my doctor?
- Would my mom feel confused by this?

If yes → redesign.

---

# 14. Final Brand Statement

Haven is a calm, intelligent notebook for noticing patterns in your life.

It does not push.
It does not cheer.
It does not shame.

It simply helps you see.
