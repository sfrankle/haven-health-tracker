name: next-task
description: Determine the next technical task to pick up from a milestone. Use when asked "what should I work on next?" or "what's the next task?". Returns a prioritised list of unblocked tasks.

## Process

### 0. Check branch state
Follow the shared procedure in `.claude/skills/_shared/branch-check.md`. Do not proceed until you are on `main`.

### 1. Get open technical tasks for the milestone
```bash
gh issue list --milestone "<MILESTONE TITLE>" --label "technical-task" --state open --limit 100 --json number,title,body
```

If the user didn't specify a milestone, check the current git branch for context, or ask which milestone they're working on.

### 2. Filter to unblocked tasks
For each open task, check for "Blocked by: #X" in the issue body. For any blocker references found, verify the blocker is still open:
```bash
gh issue view <X> --json state -q .state
```

A task is **unblocked** if it has no "Blocked by:" references, or all referenced blockers are closed.

Batch these checks — run one per blocker, but do it methodically. Build two lists:
- **Unblocked:** no open blockers
- **Blocked:** has one or more open blocker issues — note which issues are blocking it

### 3. Prioritise unblocked tasks
Order unblocked tasks by:
1. **Blocking others first** — tasks whose issue number appears in another open task's "Blocked by:" line; do these first
2. **Cross-cutting / shared infrastructure** — tasks that multiple stories depend on
3. **Issue number** — lower number (created earlier) as a tiebreaker

### 4. Present the recommendation
Show the top recommendation clearly, followed by the full unblocked list:

```
## Next task to pick up

**Recommended: #N — Title**
<one sentence on why: e.g. "blocks 3 other tasks">

## All unblocked tasks
| # | Title | Blocks |
|---|-------|--------|
| #N | ... | #X, #Y |
| #M | ... | — |

## Blocked tasks (waiting on others)
| # | Title | Blocked by |
|---|-------|------------|
| #P | ... | #Q (open) |
```

Then suggest: `To start work, say "work on #N"` — which will invoke the `work-technical-task` skill.
